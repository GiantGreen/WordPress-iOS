Block editor improvements:
On Jetpack sites, you can now edit unsupported blocks by enabling Jetpack SSO from the missing block alert. Use the handy link picker to add URLs to posts. Weâ€™ve also increased the size of the tap target on the primary action on unsupported blocks.

Fixes:
Zapped bugs that caused the page editor to become an invisible overlay and eliminated duplicate views generated when requesting a login link. In the Reader, tapping a link with an anchor now works as expected.
